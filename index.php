        <p>Sylvanas Windrunner, fallen leader of the Horde, has pierced the veil between Azeroth and the realm of the dead, setting in motion a series of events that threatens to upset the cosmic balance between life and death.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the machine of death has broken, and souls brought to the Shadowlands no longer go through The Arbiter, instead being sent straight to The Maw. As a result of this, The Maw and its Jailer have grown far stronger, while the other domains of the Shadowlands are becoming deprived of Anima, a fundamental resource in the Shadowlands. Sylvanas Windrunner has been working with the Jailer for a long time to inflict as much death as they can, and with each death and soul sent to The Maw, her and The Jailer grow stronger. Many innocent souls, including the thousands of civilians killed during the War of the Thorns, are now languishing in torment in The Maw.</p>
        <p>As adventurers arrive in the Shadowlands, they too will be sent straight to The Maw, but their innate connection to Azeroth will save them from an eternity of torment within The Maw. However, some of their allies will be left behind, while the adventurers are tasked with exploring the Shadowlands to understand the realm of the dead and hopefully becoming strong enough to return to The Maw and save their allies.</p>

          <p>We will be exploring the expansion’s namesake, the Shadowlands, in the next expansion. The Shadowlands are the area to where deceased mortal souls go to be judged, and then sent to specific places to spend their afterlives, depending on their deeds in life:</p>
          <p><li><strong>Oribos</strong>, the Eternal City is the arrival point for all souls in the Shadowlands, where they will be judged by The Arbiter, a being that determines where souls will spend their afterlives. Oribos serves as a nexus between the various domains of the Shadowlands and is a gathering point for power brokers, wheelers, dealers, and soul-traders, as well as serving as the player’s central hub in the Shadowlands.</li></p>
          <p><li><strong>Bastion</strong> is a kingdom of crystalline spires and pristine skies, ruled by the Kyrian covenant. Souls drawn to service are sent to Bastion by The Arbiter, where they examine their life’s deeds and work towards a state of virtue, letting go of their life burdens and seeking ascendance.</li></p>
          <p><li><strong>Maldraxxus</strong> is the heart of the military might of the Shadowlands, ruled by the Necrolord covenant. Although it is home to wicked beings such as abominations and necromancers, not all beings of Maldraxxus are evil – They are simply battle-hardened. Souls fueled by war who never yield and thrive in a survival of the fittest environment are sent here by The Arbiter and welcomed by the Necrolords.</li></p>
          <p><li><strong>Ardenweald</strong> is an enchanted forest ruled by the Night Fae covenant. Serving as a dark mirror to Azeroth’s Emerald Dream, Ardenweald is a place that focuses on rest, hibernation, and eventual rebirth of the soul. Souls deeply attuned to nature are sent here by The Arbiter, where they prepare for rejuvenation and rebirth.</li></p>
          <p><li><strong>Revendreth</strong> is a land of dark secrets and gothic spires, ruled by the Venthyr covenant. Souls that are prideful or flawed in life are sent here by The Arbiter to atone for their sins and seek redemption through torment inflicted by the vampiric Venthyr.</li></p>
          <p><li><strong>The Maw</strong> is the final zone of the Shadowlands, a swirling vortex composed of the vilest souls sent to the Shadowlands and ruled by The Jailer, a being who has never been seen before. The Arbiter only sends to The Maw souls that are considered to be irredeemable and a threat to the Shadowlands if left free. No one has ever escaped The Maw, and those that went to explore the vortex were never heard of again.</li></p>

      <p>Many abilities previously removed or made into talents (the so-called “pruning process”) over the years are now returning as baseline to players. Some examples were provided during BlizzCon 2019, but be mindful that this is very much not final and more unpruned abilities might return before the expansion is live.</p>
