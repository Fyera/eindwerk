                        <p>Introduced in the <strong>Wrath of the Lich King</strong> expansion, Death Knights are World of Warcraft’s first hero class. When the Lich King’s control of his death knights was broken, his former champions sought revenge for the horrors committed under his command. After their vengeance was won, the death knights found themselves without a cause and without a home. One by one they trickled into the land of the living in search of a new purpose.</p>

                    <p>In Shadowlands , they are unifying the core skills of the Death Knights by making their main skills available for all specializations, including various versatile skills that have been extremely popular in the past. Once these changes are implemented, all Death Knights can desecrate the ground around them with unholy magic to inflict damage on their opponents with <strong>Death and Decay</strong> , or use <strong>Antimagic Shield</strong> to neutralize enemy attacks. In addition, all death knight can once again use unnatural powers like <strong>Lichborne</strong> to temporarily become an undead, or using <strong>Raise Dead</strong> to summon a Ghoul to fight at their side. The New <strong>Sacrifice Pact</strong> ability enables death knights to perform a forbidden ritual and sacrifice one of their undead servants. The <strong>Corpse Explosion</strong> ability makes a glorious return as you once again can detonate your ghoul, damaging all enemies nearby. Last but not least, the frosty grip of the <strong>Ice Chains</strong> will once again root all the enemies of a death knights.</p>

                    <p>Surrounded by their dead brothers and sisters, blood death knights in the shadow lands can learn new skills and talents. <strong>Blood Tap</strong> allows Death Knights to consume the essence of killed enemies to create a rune. Whenever a charge of Bone Shield is consumed, this ability can be used again. Blood death knights also have access to <strong>Rune Shift</strong> without having to choose it as a talent.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Relish in Blood</strong> gives these undead tanks a huge healing boost for every active charge of <strong>Bone Shield</strong> and grants 5 rune power when <strong>Death and Decay</strong> is cast while <strong>Crimson Scourge</strong> is active.</p>

                    <p>All death knights possess certain abilities to awaken and control undead servants; Unholy Death Knights, however, specialize in necromancy, which is reflected in their abilities.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>All Unholy Death Knights will be able to use <strong>Summon Gargoyle</strong> (previously a talent) to summon these winged horrors.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Army of the Damned</strong> returns as an even stronger force with a familiar and faithful recruit—a Magus of the Dead. These formidable magic-wielders have fought side by side with Maldraxxus’ bannermen and their presence rallies Unholy Death Knights’ ghoulish armies, lobbing Frostbolt and Shadow Bolt spells into the enemy.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Death coil</strong> and <strong>Epidemic</strong> reduce the cooldown of <strong>Army of the Dead</strong>, which causes Unholy Death Knights to lead a steady stream of monstrous servants into battle</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Magus of the Dead also joins the Death Knight when casting <strong>Apocalypse</strong>, the cooldown of which is also reduced by casting <strong>Death coil</strong> and <strong>Epidemic</strong>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Masters and servants alike benefit from the Unholy Death Knight’s Mastery: <strong>Dreadblade</strong>. It increases both the Death Knight’s Shadow damage and the damage dealt by his minions, making his undead armies simply overrun any enemy.</p>
