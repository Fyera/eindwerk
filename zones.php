                        What lies beyond the world you know? The Shadowlands, resting place for every mortal soul—virtuous or vile—that has ever lived. Journey through planes of torment and imprisonment to those of rebirth and eternal reward.

                    <p>Those who have lived a life of service are drawn to Bastion to assume the highest duty of all-carrying souls to the Shadowlands. Amongst Bastion’s gleaming spires and sweeping vistas await challenges to test the mettle of the steadfast Kyrians.</p>
                    <p>Bastion is one of the five playable outdoor zones in the Shadowlands expansion, and is the primary home of the Kyrian covenant. A land of soaring angelic architecture, light, and purity, Bastion is a fitting home to the guardians of the noble dead. It is also the first of the four Covenant realms (Bastion, Maldraxxus, Ardenweald, and Revendreth) that new players will quest through to gain the privilege of choosing a covenant at level 60.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>A vibrant afterlife for those closely connected to the wild, Ardenweald is a domain of endless restoration tended by the mystic night fae. Within this ethernal forest, massive dream trees draw in precious anima -soul essence- to feed the spirits of nature awaiting rebirth.</p>
                    <p>Ardenweald is a counterpart of the Emerald Dream representing an eternal season in a continual cycle of death, hibernation, and rebirth. Powerful beings of nature are called here to infuse their anima into slumbering spirits, and reawaken renewed with the knowledge of the spirits of old. This prepares them for rebirth among the living, to begin the cycle of life again. Throughout the zone, players will encounter various beings of nature, including Drust, Faeries, Satyr, Spriggan, Sylvar, Tirnenn, Vorkai, and the mysterious Winter Queen.</p>

                    <p>Within war-torn Maldraxxus, might -of all kinds- makes right. Here, in the birthplace of necromantic magic, those who master the powers of death turn legions of ambitious souls into relentless undead armies.</p>
                    <p>Maldraxxus is a realm of death and decay, in which souls and their anima are used to power the military might of the Shadowlands. Souls which are drawn to this realm of the afterlife are tested for unwavering loyalty and obedience, cosigned to a single minded purpose. Visually, the zone is reminiscent of the plaguelands in Azeroth, mired in decay and fungal growths.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>A realm of looming keeps and gothic villages, Revendreth is home to the Venthyr, the harvesters of sin. The wretched souls who arrive here may find penance for their misdeeds… or merely indulge the appetites of their keepers.</p>
                    <p>Revendreth is a dark, Gothic zone with ominous castles, Victorian towns, and nightmarish creatures. Much of its architecture bears a resemblance to the fortresses of Icecrown, as well as a surprising overlap with that of Gilneas.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>To be cast into the Maw is to be doomed to a bleak eternity. It is a tumultuous, hopeless land where the vilest souls in the cosmos are imprisoned forever. Should the ancient evil chained here break free, all of reality will be consumed.</p> 
                    <p>The Maw was meant to hold the most vile and irredeemable souls, with the worst imprisoned at the center within Torghast, though since sometime around the events of Legion all souls have been redirected there instead of their intended afterlifes, siphoning anima away from the rest of the Shadowlands. It is a tumultuous, hopeless land where the vilest souls in the cosmos are imprisoned forever, and none have ever been known to escape. When Sylvanas Windrunner experienced her second death after throwing herself from the top of Icecrown Citadel, her soul was taken there for only the briefest moment before being saved by the Val'kyr; during that short time she experienced only a cold, hopeless darkness, surrounded by fear and suffering.</p>
