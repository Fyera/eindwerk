                        <p>When the pandaren were subjugated by the mogu centuries ago, it was the Monks that brought hope to a seemingly dim future. Restricted from using weapons by their slave masters, these pandaren instead focused on harnessing their chi and learning weaponless combat. When the opportunity for revolution struck, they were well-trained to throw off the yoke of oppression.</p>

                    <p><strong>Expel Harm</strong>, <strong>Fortifying Brew</strong>, <strong>Spinning Crane Kick</strong>, and <strong>Touch of Death</strong> are now available to all the monks. In addition, <strong>Touch of Death</strong> returns to the original design and kills enemies with less health than the monk. Each specialization also receives a unique bonus when dealing damage with <strong>Touch of Death</strong>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>All three specializations will also be able to summon their Celestial to the battlefield with <strong>Invoke Xuen, the White Tiger</strong>; <strong>Invoke Niuzao, the Black Ox</strong>; and <strong>Invoke Yu’lon, the Jade Serpent</strong> (previously Talents).</p>

                    <p>The steadfast Brewmaster Monks are ready for anything to restore balance, and can now choose between two one-handed or a two-handed weapons to defeat their enemies once again.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You will also get back a passive ability: <strong>Shuffle</strong>. It increases the amount of physical damage that’s staggered when the Monk uses one of several abilities including <strong>Blackout Kick</strong> (previously called <strong>Blackout Strike</strong>), <strong>Keg Smash</strong>, and <strong>Spinning Crane Kick</strong>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Celestial Brew</strong> is a new ability that absorbs damage based on the monk’s attack power.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Clash</strong> makes a return which causes both the Monk and their target bull-rush each other and—at the epicenter of the conflict—root their opponent for short duration.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>All Brewmaster Monks can also use <strong>Invoke Niuzao, the Black Ox</strong> (previously a talent) to help with the staggered damage. Niuzao also deals bonus damage based on the adjusted staggered damage.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>The Touch of Death</strong> of Brewmaster monks will instantly kill any creature with less health than the Monk. You may cast <strong>Provoke</strong> on the statue to taunt all enemies near the statue.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Master brewers can add divine powers to their brews with the new <strong>Celestial Flames</strong> talent. Drinking brews has a moderate chance to grant <strong>Celestial Flames</strong>, which slightly increases <strong>Breath of mistweaver</strong>’s damage reduction and spreads its periodic damage effect to targets struck with <strong>Spinning Crane Kick</strong>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Touch of Death</strong> now instantly kills any creature with less health than the Mistweaver monk and creates healing spheres for its allies.</p>

                    <p><strong>Invoke Chi-Ji, the Red Crane</strong> returns as a talent for Mistweaver monks. It strengthens the player’s Physical damage moderately and healing their allies for part of the damage inflicted on enemies. <strong>Chi-Ji</strong> also makes Mistweaver Monks immune to movement-impairing abilities so that they can constantly be on the move during combat.</p>
